  "summary": "Pivot is off for the holiday! In the meantime, we're bringing you an episode of On With Kara Swisher.\nKara is chatting with Bill Gates, the co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft, and the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Bill has been one of the richest people in the world for decades, and he's also spent decades giving away his fortune and working on some of humanity’s most vexing challenges. That’s the focus of his Netflix docuseries What’s Next? The Future with Bill Gates, where he dives into AI, misinformation, global warming, inequality, and disease. Kara pushes him on the issues, his proposed solutions, and the always tricky details — plus, she finds out who Bill wants to win the presidential election. \nThis interview was recorded in front of a live audience in New York City.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
