  "summary": "Kara and Scott discuss the protests in Los Angeles, dig into Trump's escalating authoritarian tactics, and debate how the Democratic Party should fight back. They also get some on-the-ground perspective from New York Times reporter Livia Albeck-Ripka, who's been covering the protests.

Discovery confirms it’s splitting into two companies, just as Kara and Scott predicted. We’ve got another call in show coming up!
