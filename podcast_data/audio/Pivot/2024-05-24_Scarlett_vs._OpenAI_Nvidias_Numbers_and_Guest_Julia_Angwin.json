  "summary": "Kara and Scott discuss the Department of Justice's antitrust suit against Live Nation, News Corp's $250 million deal with OpenAI, and Nestle's new frozen food brand aimed at Ozempic users. Then, Scarlett Johansson alleges OpenAI copied her voice after she refused to license it to Sam Altman, though new reporting says a voice actress was hired months earlier. How does OpenAI move past these accusations, and regain trust? Plus, Nvidia shares blockbuster earnings, while Trump Media's numbers are lackluster. Finally, our Friend of Pivot is Julia Angwin, CEO and founder of Proof News, and a contributing opinion writer for the New York Times. Julia shares why she thinks AI hype is overblown, and why she opposes the TikTok ban.\n\nFollow Julia at @juliaangwin\nFollow us on Instagram and Threads at @pivotpodcastofficial.\nFollow us on TikTok at @pivotpodcast.\nSend us your questions by calling us at 855-51-PIVOT, or at nymag.com/pivot.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
