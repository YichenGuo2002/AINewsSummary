They also discuss Facebook possibly banning political ads, and why it's a cop-out. They go deeper on the issue with Friend of Pivot Rashad Robinson, the Executive Director of Color of Change, who has been meeting with Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg after helping to organize the July ad boycott of the platform. Kara's fail is Tucker Carlson's head writer getting caught publicly writing racist, sexist and homophobic comments on public forums.
