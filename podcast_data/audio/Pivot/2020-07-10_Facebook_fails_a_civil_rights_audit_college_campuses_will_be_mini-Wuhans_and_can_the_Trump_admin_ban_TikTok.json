  "summary": "Kara and Scott talk about an audit released about Facebook's lack of civil rights practices, the groups that have pushed them on moderating their platform, and Sheryl Sandberg's first public response. They also discuss the US' possible ban on TikTok, the China based social media app. In Listener Mail, we get a question about why colleges are not lowering tuition even though many will only be offering online courses in the fall. In predictions, Scott thinks Trumps visa ban on foreign students not enrolled in in-person schools will have economic repercussions.
