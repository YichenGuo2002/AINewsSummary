  "summary": "We're bringing you a special episode of On With Kara Swisher! Kara sits down for a live interview with Meta's Yann LeCun, an “early AI prophet” and the brains behind the largest open-source large language model in the world. The two discuss the potential dangers that come with open-source models, the massive amounts of money pouring into AI research, and the pros and cons of AI regulation. They also dive into LeCun’s surprisingly spicy social media feeds — unlike a lot of tech employees who toe the HR line, LeCun isn’t afraid to say what he thinks of Elon Musk or President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThis interview was recorded live at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center in Washington, DC as part of their Discovery Series.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
