  "summary": "AI is amazing… or terrifying, depending on who you ask. This is a technology that elicits strong, almost existential reactions. So, as a Memorial Day special, we're running an episode of Recode Media with Peter Kafka that digs into the giant ambitions and enormous concerns people have about the very same tech.\nFirst up: Joshua Browder (@jbrowder1), a Stanford computer science dropout who tried to get an AI lawyer into court.\nThen: Microsoft's CTO Kevin Scott (@kevin_scott) pitches a bright AI future. \nPlus: hype-deflator, cognitive scientist and author Gary Marcus (@GaryMarcus) believes in AI, but he thinks the giants of Silicon Valley are scaling flawed technology now—with potentially dangerous consequences. \nSubscribe for free to Recode Media to make sure you get the whole series: https://bit.ly/3IOpWuB\nPivot will return on Friday!\nLearn more about your ad choices.
