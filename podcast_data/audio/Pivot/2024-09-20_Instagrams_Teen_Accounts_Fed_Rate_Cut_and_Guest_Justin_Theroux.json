  "summary": "Kara and Scott discuss Donald Trump's crypto plans, and Melania's bizarre promotional videos for her book. Then, Instagram is rolling out teen accounts, with default privacy for users under 18, messaging restrictions, and more. Will these changes do some actual good, or will they just help Instagram avoid scrutiny and regulation? Plus, the Fed makes a major rate cut â€“ what does that mean for consumers and investors?

Justin chats about his new movie, \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,\" how he's experimenting with AI, and why he's a Pivot superfan.\n\nFollow us on Instagram and Threads at @pivotpodcastofficial.\nFollow us on TikTok at @pivotpodcast.\nSend us your questions by calling us at 855-51-PIVOT, or at nymag.com/pivot.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
