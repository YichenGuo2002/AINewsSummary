  "summary": "Kara and Scott discuss Nvidiaâ€™s roller coaster week, Waymo making robotaxis available for everyone in San Francisco, and what's next for Julian Assange after his release. Then, the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Biden administration in a social media content moderation case. Will that set a precedent for future social media/misinformation rulings?
