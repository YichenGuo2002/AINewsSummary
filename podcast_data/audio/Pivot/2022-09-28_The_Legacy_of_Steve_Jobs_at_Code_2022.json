  "summary": "Tim Cook, Sir Jony Ive, and Laurene Powell Jobs unpack the life and work of Steve Jobs, the legendary Apple co-founder who changed consumer technology forever. Jobs was a regular guest at Code conferences, appearing at the first All Things D in 2003. Over the years on the Code stage, he predicted the end of the PC era, bantered with his arch-rival Bill Gates, and famously denied— and later teased— plans for the iPhone. Now, he’s remembered by three luminaries who knew him best: Cook, his protege and successor; Ives, who translated his ideas into iconic designs; and Powell Jobs, founder of Emerson Collective and Jobs’ wife of 20 years, until his death in 2011.\nRecorded September 7, 2022 in Los Angeles.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
