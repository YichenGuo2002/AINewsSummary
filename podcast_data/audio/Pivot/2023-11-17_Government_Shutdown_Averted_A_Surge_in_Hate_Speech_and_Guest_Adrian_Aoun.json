  "summary": "Kara and Scott discuss Nikki Haley's social media stance, Truth Social's waning prospects, and the revelation that Google sends a third of Safari ad revenue to Apple. And don’t worry, they also talk about the Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez photoshoot. You’re welcome/we’re sorry. Then, in the fight club that is DC, a government shutdown has been averted for now. Also, a look at how hate speech has surged on social media since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Then we’re joined by Friend of Pivot, Adrian Aoun, CEO and Founder of the health tech startup Forward, which is launching what it calls, “the world’s first AI doctor’s office.”\n\nYou can find Forward on Twitter at @goforward.\nFollow us on Instagram and Threads at @pivotpodcastofficial.\nFollow us on TikTok at @pivotpodcast.\nSend us your questions by calling us at 855-51-PIVOT, or at nymag.com/pivot.\n\nEditorial Note: In our original recording of this episode, we cited erroneous reporting from CNBC that Trump Media & Technology Group, Truth Social's parent company, had lost $73 million since its launch in early 2021. The correct operating loss is $35 million, according to SEC filings by the company. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
