They talk to Gig Workers Collective co-founder Vanessa Bain about how policy makers and companies can better protect workers; then, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi talks about why the company is fighting against classifying its workers as employees in California, the food delivery business, and whether the company is really committed to self-driving cars.\nGet your Pivot Schooled hats, mugs, shirts and more at PivotSchooled.com/Shop.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
