  "summary": "Kara and Scott discuss Morning Joe anchors Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski revealing they paid a visit to Donald Trump to \"restart communications,\" and the sheer brilliance of The Onion buying Alex Jones's Infowars. Then, the news of RFK, Jr.'s HHS Secretary nomination rattles the markets, and Trump says he wants someone \"big\" for Treasury Secretary. Plus, the Kids Online Safety Act stalls in Congress, thanks in part to Big Tech's $90 million lobbying efforts.
