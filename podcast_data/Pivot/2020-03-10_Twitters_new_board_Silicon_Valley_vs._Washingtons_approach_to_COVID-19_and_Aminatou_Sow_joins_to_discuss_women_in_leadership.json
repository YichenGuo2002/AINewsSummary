  "summary": "Kara and Scott talk about the deal reached at Twitter, the fate of Jack Dorsey and his tenure as CEO. They discuss how big tech companies have been stepping up to take care of gig-workers as COVID-19 spreads; Silicon Valley's approach has been drastically different from the government's, thus far.
