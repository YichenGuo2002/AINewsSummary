  "summary": "Kara and Scott chat about the delay of the tech antitrust hearing, the \"unprecedented culture crisis\" at Facebook, and the think-tank financed by Big Tech that is schmoozing foreign regulators. Friend of Pivot Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, joins to talk about the return of professional basketball and why the NBA's \"bubble\" at Disney World is safer than the attempted comebacks of football and baseball; Cuban also discusses his Twitter battle with Ted Cruz, why he's optimistic about a COVID-19 vaccine, and why a new wave of legalized sports gambling is on the horizon. Also: What should Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have behind them when they testify, what should we take away from AOC's battle with Ted Yoho, and can an AI algorithm write better than Kara Swisher?\nHey, listeners: We want your reactions to and questions about Wednesday's tech antitrust hearing.
