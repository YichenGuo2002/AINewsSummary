  "summary": "Pivot is off for the holiday! In the meantime, we're bringing you an episode of On With Kara Swisher.\nKara interviews Mira Murati, Chief Technology Officer at OpenAI, and one of the most powerful people in tech. Murati has helped the company skyrocket to the forefront of the generative AI boom, and Apple’s recent announcement that it will soon put ChatGPT in its iPhones, iPads and laptops will only help increase their reach. But there have been some issues along the way - including CEO Sam Altman's brief ouster, accusations of putting profit over safety, and the controversy over whether the company stole Scarlett Johansson's voice. Kara and Murati discuss it all.\n\nThis interview was recorded live at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center in Washington, DC as part of their new Discovery Series.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
