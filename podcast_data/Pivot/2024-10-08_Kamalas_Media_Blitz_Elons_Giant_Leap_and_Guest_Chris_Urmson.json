  "summary": "Kara and Scott discuss Kamala Harris's big media blitz, and the podcast (aside from Pivot) that she should really appear on. Then, Elon Musk leapt into the air at Donald Trump's weekend rally in Pennsylvania, and a lot of people had thoughts. Plus, Google is finally facing some real competition when it comes to the $300 billion search advertising business. Our Friend of Pivot is Chris Urmson, founder and CEO of Aurora, a start-up focusing on autonomous trucking. Chris explains how Aurora is getting driverless trucks on the road, and why the technology could be good for the economy.\n\nFollow Chris at @chris_urmson\nFollow us on Instagram and Threads at @pivotpodcastofficial.\nFollow us on TikTok at @pivotpodcast.\nSend us your questions by calling us at 855-51-PIVOT, or at nymag.com/pivot.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
