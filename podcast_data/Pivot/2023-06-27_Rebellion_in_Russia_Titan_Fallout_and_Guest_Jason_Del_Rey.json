  "summary": "Breaking news: Kara Swisher will not referee the cage match between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. Also, SpaceX is looking to up its valuation, and Meta wants to shut down access to news in Canada. And this weekend’s insurrection in Russia revealed how unequipped social media is to cover breaking news. Plus, an investigation into the Titan submersible implosion may lead to new regulations.
