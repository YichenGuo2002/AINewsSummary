  "summary": "Kara and Scott speculate about what is happening at Disney following Bob Iger's abrupt exit. They talk about the stock market's tumble in reaction to coronavirus. Scott breaks down which companies should be on the offense and which ones should be on the defense... and why he thinks Peleton may be one of the companies that see a spike during the coronavirus scare.

In predictions, Scott thinks Pence will fail at his job to control the coronavirus pandemic in the US and that Nikki Haley joins the Trump ticket.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
