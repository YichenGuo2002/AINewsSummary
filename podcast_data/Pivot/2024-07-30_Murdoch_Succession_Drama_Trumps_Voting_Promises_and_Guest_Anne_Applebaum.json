  "summary": "Kara and Scott discuss Biden's proposal to reform the Supreme Court, and Rupert Murdoch's real-life succession drama. Then, Elon is dealing with some family drama of his own, as his estranged daughter and his ex's mother call him out on social media. He also seems to have violated his own platform's policies, by sharing a deep fake of a Kamala Harris ad. Plus, Donald Trump courts the Bitcoin bros and Christian voters, as Kamala raises millions. Finally, our Friend of Pivot is Anne Applebaum, staff writer at The Atlantic, and author of \"Autocracy, Inc.: The Dictators Who Want to Run the World.\" Anne explains how the current group of world autocrats will stop at nothing to gain absolute power, and digs into the dangers of a Trump second term.\nFollow Anne at @anneapplebaum\nFollow us on Instagram and Threads at @pivotpodcastofficial.\nFollow us on TikTok at @pivotpodcast.\nSend us your questions by calling us at 855-51-PIVOT, or at nymag.com/pivot.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
