  "summary": "Kara and Scott are joined by Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, and the author of the new book: \"Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future.\" They discuss DeepSeek hype and fears, and why spending money on AI is a good thing. Then, Meta settles with Trump for $25 million, and the White House takes a page out of Elon's playbook to offer buyouts to federal employees. Plus, the contentious (and frightening) RFK, Jr. hearings. And will Kara get a podcaster seat at the White House briefings?\nFollow us on Instagram and Threads at @pivotpodcastofficial.\nFollow us on Bluesky at @pivotpod.bsky.social.\nFollow us on TikTok at @pivotpodcast.\nSend us your questions by calling us at 855-51-PIVOT, or at nymag.com/pivot.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
