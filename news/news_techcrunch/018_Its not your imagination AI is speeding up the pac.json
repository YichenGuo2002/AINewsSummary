  "full_article": "If the adoption of AI feels different from any tech revolution you may have experienced before — mobile, social, cloud computing — it actually is.\n\nVenture capitalist Mary Meeker just droppeda 340-page slideshow report— which used the word “unprecedented” on 51 of those pages — to describe the speed at which AI is being developed, adopted, spent on, and used, backed up with chart after chart.\n\n“The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented, as supported by the data,” she writes in the report, called “Trends — Artificial Intelligence.”\n\nThere’s a certain poetic history to this person writing this kind of report. Meeker is the founder and general partner at VC firm Bond and was onceknown as Queen of the Internetfor her previous annual Internet Trends reports. Before founding Bond, she ran Kleiner Perkins’ growth practice, from 2010-2019, where she backed companies like Facebook, Spotify, Ring, and Block (then Square).\n\nShe hasn’t released a trends report since 2019. But she dusted off her skills to document, in laser detail, how AI adoption has outpaced any other tech in human history.\n\nChatGPTreaching800 million users in 17 months: unprecedented. The number of companies andthe rate at which so many othersare hitting high annual recurring revenue rates: also unprecedented.\n\nThe speed at which costs of usage are dropping: unprecedented. While the costs of training a model (also unprecedented) is up to $1 billion, inference costs — for example, those paying to use the tech — has already dropped 99% over two years, when calculating cost per 1 million tokens, she writes, citing researchfrom Stanford.\n\nThe pace at whichcompetitors are matching each other’s features, at a fraction of the cost, including open source options, particularly Chinese models: unprecedented. For example, she points out that Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell GPU uses 105,000x less energy per token than the company’s 2014 Kepler GPU predecessor.\n\nMeanwhile, chips from Google, like its TPU (tensor processing unit), andAmazon’s Trainium, are being developed at scale for their clouds — that’s moving quickly, too. “These aren’t side projects — they’re foundational bets,” she writes.\n\nThe one area where AI hasn’t outpaced every other tech revolution is in financial returns. WhileVCs are pouring moneyon the AI fire as fast as they can, AI companies and cloud service providers are also burning through cash. AI requires massive investments in infrastructure.\n\nThat’s good for consumers and enterprises, the beneficiaries of fast improvements, while competition lowers costs, Meeker points out. But the jury is still out over which of the current crop of companies will become long-term, profitable, next-generation tech giants. “Only time will tell which side of the money-making equation the current AI aspirants will land,” she writes.\n\nAs for the rest of us: Just hold on to your hats.\n\nTopics\n\n© 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC."
